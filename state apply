1.  To apply this state, run the following command:

    ```
    [root@master salt]#  salt-ssh minion-to-be-added state.apply install_salt_minion

    ```

2.  Check that minion's key is pending for acceptance by using the `salt-key` command:

    ```
    [root@master salt]# salt-key -l un
    Unaccepted Keys:
        minion-to-be-added

    ```

3.  To complete the minion's configuration, accept its public key:

    ```
    [root@master salt]# salt-key -a minion-to-be-added

    ```

    Once the minion key is accepted, the minion is fully configured and ready for command execution.
