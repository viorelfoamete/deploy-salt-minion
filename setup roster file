Set Up Salt Roster File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Roster file contains target system information, connection details and credentials. The Default location for the Roster file is: `/etc/salt/roster`.

> Note
>
> The Roster file is configured on the master server.

1.  Open `/etc/salt/roster` with an editor. Define the client systems, by adding the following lines to the file:

    This is an example of minimal host definition

    /etc/salt/roster


    ```
    minion-to-be-added:
         host: <IPADDRESS OR HOSTNAME>
         user: <username>
         passwd: <password>
    ```



    > Note
    >
    > The Roster file stores data in YAML format. Do not add unnecessary spaces to the config file.

2.  If you have a public key stored on the minion, and a private key on the master system, you can configure access to a minion using a private key. For public key authentication, add the following lines to the Roster file:

    /etc/salt/roster


    ```
    #This is an example of minimal host definition using private key:
    minion-to-be-added:
        host: <IPADDRESS OR HOSTNAME>
        user: <username>
        priv: /<username_home_folder>/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

    > Note
    >
    > Using SSH keys is the safest way to access your minions because passwords are not being stored in plain text.

3.  To set up connection to a minion as a regular user, you have to configure a few files. In this case Salt will leverage privileges via sudo. In order to use sudo, set `sudo: True` in the `host definition` section of the Roster file. By default sudo will only work when the real user is logged in over TTY. You can overcome this in two ways:

    a. Disable the TTY check by commenting a line in the sudoers file on your minion:

    /etc/sudoers

    ```
    # Defaults requiretty
    ```

    b. Force TTY allocation by setting the `tty: True` option in your Roster file:

    /etc/salt/roster

    ```
    123456
    ```


    ```
    minion-to-be-added:
        host: <IPADDRESS OR HOSTNAME>
        user: <username>
        passwd: <password>
        sudo: True
        tty: True
    ```


    > Note
    >
    > Permissions leverage via sudo works only if the NOPASSWD option is set up for the user that is connecting to the minion in `/etc/sudoers`. More information on Roster files can be found in the [Roster files documentation](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/ssh/roster.html#ssh-roster).

4.  Check that the master server has access to the client using the `salt-ssh` command:

    ```
    [root@master ~]# salt-ssh minion-to-be-added test.ping

    ```

    The output should be:

    ```
    minion-to-be-added:
        True

    ```

    > Note
    >
    > If SSH keys weren't deployed, you may receive the `The host key needs to be accepted, to auto accept run salt-ssh with the -i flag:` message. In this case just run `salt-ssh` with -i flag. This key will let Salt automatically accept a minion's public key. This has to be done only once, during the initial SSH keys exchange.
